# Crisis Management VR Training for Educators

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates a **VR-based simulation** designed to help educators effectively manage and respond to different types of crises in the classroom. The simulation covers three major scenarios: **Human-related Crises** (e.g., school shootings), **Instructional Failures** (e.g., lab accidents), and **Natural Disasters** (e.g., earthquakes). 

By immersing teachers in realistic crisis situations, the VR training allows them to practice decision-making and emergency protocols in a safe and controlled environment. The objective is to improve response times, enhance preparedness, and ultimately ensure the safety and well-being of students.

## **Features**

- **Realistic Scenarios**: Teachers can experience a variety of crisis situations, each with its own set of protocols.
- **Decision-Making Process**: Users must follow the correct steps to manage each crisis, with consequences for both success and failure.
- **Interactive Environment**: Users engage with the scenario, making choices that affect the outcome, offering a hands-on learning experience.

## **Purpose**

This project aims to demonstrate how VR can be used to train teachers for emergency situations, fostering better decision-making and crisis management skills. The simulation emphasizes the importance of preparation and practice, ensuring educators are ready to act when real-life crises occur.
